# Fishery 

A full description of the fishery's history can be found in the 2020 BSAI octopus assessment [@Ormseth2020_assessment_octopus]. What follows are any recent significant changes to the fishery or management measures.

*Directed Fishery*

There is no federally-managed directed fishery for octopus in the BSAI. The State of Alaska allows for directed (under a special commissionerâ€™s permit) and incidental catch of octopus in state waters. Since 2006, the number of permits for direct octopus fishing has been declining. The catch of octopus in state waters has been predominately incidental [@Bevaart2022; @Nichols2022].


*Incidental Catch*

Octopus are caught incidentally throughout the BSAI in both state and federally-managed bottom trawl, longline, and pot fisheries. Since 2003, the total octopus catch in federal waters (including discards) has been estimated using the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Alaska Regional Office catch accounting system. Total incidental catch range from approximately 200-700 t with high year-to year variability (Table `r params$chapter`-\@ref(tab:tab-catch-OFL)). In 2011, the catch for octopus in BSAI (577 t) exceeded the OFL (528 t) resulting in NMFS closing the directed fishing for Pacific cod with pot gear in the BSAI on October 21, 2011. The following year, an alternative Tier 6 method for determining harvest levels was introduced. Since then, all catches have been nearly an order of magnitude below the recommended ABC (Table `r params$chapter`-\@ref(tab:tab-catch-OFL)).
