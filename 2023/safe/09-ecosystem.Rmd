# Ecosystem Considerations

A full description of the ecosystem considerations can be found in the 2020 BSAI octopus assessment [@Ormseth2020_assessment_octopus]. There is also thorough ecological description in the **Risk Table and ABC recommendation** segment under the **Results** section. What follows is an abbreviation from the 2020 BSAI octopus assessment of information not included in the **Results** section.

The majority of the octopus incidental catch is taken in pot gear fished for Pacific cod. To avoid gear conflicts with trawlers, cod pots are usually deployed inside of no-trawl zones or in rocky areas unsuitable for trawling. The low retention rate of octopus in the BSAI, and the high survival rate of discarded octopus suggest that effects on the octopus population is minor.
