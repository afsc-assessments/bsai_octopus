# Analytical approach

## General Model Structure

The available data for octopus in the BSAI do not support quantitative catch-at-age modeling for either individual species of octopus or for the multi-species complex. There are also no reliable biomass estimates available for Tier 5 methods. Therefore, we continue to use the alternative Tier 6 method, based on a predation-based estimate of total natural mortality (*N*) [@conners2011assessment_octopus]. We use the letter *N* for the total natural mortality in tons to distinguish it from the *M* (continuous individual mortality rate) that is used widely in other stock assessment models [@Ormseth2020_assessment_octopus].

This alternative Tier 6 method utilizes diet data from the AFSC’s food habits database to estimate the total amount of octopus consumed by their main predator in the BSAI: Pacific cod. The estimated amount of octopus consumed by Pacific cod is thought to be a conservative estimate of the total natural mortality *N* for octopus, since it does not include mortality from other predators (i.e., marine mammals) or non-predation mortality. It is important to note that this methodology calculates a single reference point that is averaged over multiple years in order to avoid assuming a population increase when it is just an increase in predation. Therefore, the reference point should be periodically updated but not annually. This analysis was first performed in 2011 [@conners2011assessment_octopus] and last updated in the 2016 assessment [@conners2016assessment].


## Parameter Estimates

*Total Natural Mortality (N)* \
*N* was estimated using previously defined methods. The annual geometric mean values of *N* can be found in Table `r params$chapter`-\@ref(tab:tab-stomach-mean). The OFL equals geometric mean of the annual values.  See “General Model Structure” for a description and the 2016 BSAI octopus assessment [@conners2016assessment] for more details.
