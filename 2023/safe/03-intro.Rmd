# Introduction

The full introduction can be found in the 2020 BSAI octopus assessment [@Ormseth2020_assessment_octopus]. What follows is an abbreviation of the 2020 introduction.

Octopuses are marine mollusks in the class Cephalopoda. The cephalopods, whose name literally means head foot, have their appendages attached to the head and include octopuses, squids, and nautiluses. The octopuses (order Octopoda) have only eight appendages/arms and, unlike other cephalopods, lack shells, pens, and tentacles. There are two groups of Octopoda, the cirrate and the incirrate. The cirrate have cirri (cilia-like strands on the suckers), possess paddle-shaped fins suitable for swimming in their pelagic and epibenthic ocean habitats [@Boyle_and_Rodhouse_2005_book], and are much less common than the incirrate, which contain the more traditional forms of octopus. Octopuses are found in every ocean in the world and range in size from less than 20 cm to over 3 m (total length); the latter is a record held by *Enteroctopus dofleini* [@Wulker1910]. The most common octopus species observed in the Alaska Fishery Science Center (AFSC) bottom trawl survey is *E. dofleini*, but there are at least seven other species found in the Bering Sea: *Sasakiopus salebrosus*, *Benthoctopus leioderma*, *Benthoctopus oregonensis*, *Graneledone boreopacifica*, *Opisthoteuthis californiana*, *Japetella diaphana* and *Vampyroteuthis infernalis*. These eight species represent seven genera and can be found from less than 10-m to greater than 1500-m depth. All but one, *J. diaphana*, are benthic octopuses. The mesopelagic *V. infernalis* is a cephalopod that shares similarities with both octopuses and squids, but is included in the octopus assessment. The state of knowledge of octopuses in the BSAI, including the true species composition, is very limited.
