# Data

## Fishery

*Catch*

See Table `r params$chapter`-\@ref(tab:tab-catch-OFL) and Figure `r params$chapter`-\@ref(fig:fig-catch) for a time series of the total catch from 1997 to `r year`. The `r year` catch data are incomplete. They were updated through `r last_cat_date`. 

## Survey

*AFSC Trawl Survey Biomass Estimate*

Bottom trawl surveys were conducted on an annual basis in the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) shelf and biennially in the Aleutian Islands (AI) beginning in 2000. Both of these surveys were canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The EBS slope surveys were conducted irregularly and was last sampled in 2016.  Estimated biomass for the octopus stock complex based on the AFSC bottom trawl surveys are shown in Tables `r params$chapter`-\@ref(tab:tab-AI-survey),-\@ref(tab:tab-shelf-survey) and -\@ref(tab:tab-slope-survey). Biomass estimates in the EBS and AI show high year-to-year variability (Figure `r params$chapter`-\@ref(fig:fig-survey-bio)). There is a large sampling variance associated with estimates from the shelf surveys because a large number of tows do not capture octopuses. It is impossible to determine how much of the yearâ€“to-year variability in the estimated biomass reflects true variation in abundance or is a result of sampling variation. For example, the 1997 biomass estimate from the shelf survey (254 t) approximately equaled the estimated commercial catch (249 t). This suggests that the 1997 biomass estimate was unreasonably low. The `r year` EBS biomass estimate (`r format(round(cur_ebs_shelf), big.mark=",")` t) is a decrease of `r ch_ebs_shelf`% from `r year-1` (`r format(round(prior_ebs_shelf), big.mark=",")` t). The `r year` EBS biomass estimate is also `r ch_avg_ebs_shelf`% lower than the long-term average biomass estimate (`r format(round(avg_shelf), big.mark=",")` t) and is the lowest biomass estimate since 2014.


## Other Data

The BSAI octopus assessment utilizes diet data from Pacific cod, the main predator of Octopus in the BSAI. These data area available from the AFSC food habits group (Table `r params$chapter`-\@ref(tab:tab-stomach-number)). A total of 13,614 stomachs from 2012-2013 and 2016-2023 have been added to the data set since the last assessment update in 2016.
